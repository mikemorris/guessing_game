- `rustup doc --book` doesn't seem to do anything
- `cargo new hello_cargo` creates `src/lib.rs`, not `main.rs`
- `cargo check` doesn't exist?
- Maybe a missing `extern crate rand;`?
- error: cannot document a package where a library and a binary have the same name. Consider renaming one or marking the target as `doc = false`
