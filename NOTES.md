- `rustup doc --book` doesn't seem to do anything
- error: 'rustfmt' is not installed for the toolchain 'stable-x86_64-apple-darwin'
  - To install, run `rustup component add rustfmt --toolchain stable-x86_64-apple-darwin`
  - error: toolchain 'stable-x86_64-apple-darwin' does not contain component 'rustfmt' for target 'x86_64-apple-darwin'
  - https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup.rs/issues/1558
- `cargo new hello_cargo` creates `src/lib.rs`, not `main.rs`
  - this default seems to no longer be the case on current version of rustup/rustc?
- `cargo check` doesn't exist?
  - w0rp/ale vim plugin seems to integrate with it fine though?
- Maybe a missing `extern crate rand;`?
- `cargo doc`
  - error: cannot document a package where a library and a binary have the same name. Consider renaming one or marking the target as `doc = false`
- rand version 0.5.5 at https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch07-02-modules-and-use-to-control-scope-and-privacy.html#using-external-packages
